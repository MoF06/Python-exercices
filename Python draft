In the tutorial, you defined several variables to calculate the total number of seconds in a year.  Run the next code cell to do the calculation here.

# Create variables
num_years = 4
days_per_year = 365 
hours_per_day = 24
mins_per_hour = 60
secs_per_min = 60

# Calculate number of seconds in four years
total_secs = secs_per_min * mins_per_hour * hours_per_day * days_per_year * num_years
print(total_secs)

# TODO: Set the value of the births_per_min variable
births_per_min = 250

# TODO: Set the value of the births_per_day variable
births_per_day = 250 * mins_per_hour * hours_per_day 

# Number of total passengers
total = len(titanic_data)
print(total)

# Number of passengers who survived
survived = (titanic_data.Survived == 1).sum()
print(survived)

# Number of passengers under 18
minors = (titanic_data.Age < 18).sum()
print(minors)

# TODO: Fill in the value of the survived_fraction variable
survived_fraction = survived / total 

# Print the value of the variable
print(survived_fraction)

# TODO: Fill in the value of the minors_fraction variable
minors_fraction = minors / total 

# Print the value of the variable
print(minors_fraction)
